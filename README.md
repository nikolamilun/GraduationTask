# GraduationTask
 A graduation task in my school. Wasn't really hard but I was testing my ADO.NET skills.
 To begin, you first have to have an MSSQL Server instance running on your PC. To do that, you first need to install MSSQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (how to do that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsXWszvjMBM).
 Also, to open the project you must have MS Visual Studio installed (installation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6Axw8pAWv0), and after that open the .sln file (GraduationTask/GraduationTask.sln) and debug the program.
 Before even starting the application, you have to first copy the database files (graduationTask.mdf and graduationTask_log.ldf) into your SQL Server instance (how to do it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhIr9Qf-oHw).
 In order for the application to work, you also have to type in the name of your SQL Server instance when entering the application. After that, you are free to use it.
 Hope you like my work ^^
