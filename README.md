# GraduationTask
 A graduation task in my school. Wasn't really hard but I was testing my ADO.NET skills.
 To begin, you first have to have an MSSQL Server instance running on your PC. To do that, you first need to install MSSQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (how to do that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsXWszvjMBM).
 Before even starting the application, you have to first copy the database files into your SQL Server instance (how to do it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhIr9Qf-oHw).
 In order for the application to work, you also have to type in the name of your SQL Server instance when entering the application. After that, you are free to use it.
 Hope you like my work ^^
